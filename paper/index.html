            As campaigning for the U.S. Presidential Elections reaches its final
            stage, U.S. media reported an FBI probe launched into an alleged
            hacking incident in which the mobile phones of Donald Trump and his
            running mate, JD Vance, were reportedly compromised by Chinese
            hackers.<br />According to international news reports, hackers
            linked to China allegedly targeted the mobile phones of the United
            States Republican presidential candidate, his running mate, and
            individuals associated with the campaign of Democratic nominee
            Kamala Harris.<br />
            They are said to have tapped into the network of mobile phone
            provider Verizon; however, investigators are now probing whether any
            data was gathered from the phones of these leaders or not

            Nvidia dethroned Apple as the world's most valuable company on
            Friday following a record-setting rally in the stock, powered by
            insatiable demand for its specialized artificial intelligence chips.
            Nvidia's stock market value briefly touched $3.53 trillion, slightly
            above Apple's $3.52 trillion, LSEG data showed. Nvidia was last up
            2.2%, with a market value of $3.52 trillion, while Apple's shares
            rose 0.9%, valuing the iPhone maker at $3.54 trillion. In June,
            Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable company before it
            was overtaken by Microsoft and Apple. The tech trio's market
            capitalizations have been neck-and-neck for several months.
            Microsoft's market value stood at $3.20 trillion, with its stock up
            1.3%. The Silicon Valley chipmaker is the dominant supplier of
            processors used in AI computing, and the company has become the
            biggest winner in a race between Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms
            and other heavyweights to dominate the emerging technology.

            Elon Musk, the tech mogul who is the world’s richest man, plunged
            more than $70 million of his personal fortune into helping Donald
            Trump and other Republicans win in November’s election Elon Musk, a
            tech mogul who is the world's richest person, plunged more than $70
            million into helping Donald Trump and other Republicans win in
            November's election, making him one of the biggest donors to GOP
            causes this campaign season, according to campaign finance
            disclosures released this week. Musk made the donation over the
            summer to America PAC, a super political action committee he
            launched in May to aid Trump in his bid to return to the White
            House. It quickly became a central player in Trump's election
            effort.

          <p>
            They propose a model to teach responsibility to autonomous AI
            agents, such as systems or entities like drones, robots, vehicles
            etc. which can perform tasks and operate independently without any
            human intervention.Imagine if adaptive traffic lights on the road
            start communicating with each other and regulate the traffic better,
            or if an autonomous agent (advanced form of Artificial Intelligence)
            tells a supply chain manager when is the best time to ship an order.
            In a new study by the International Institute of Information
            Technology Bangalore’s (IIITB), researchers have come up with a
            model called Computational Transcendence which can help autonomous
            agents do these tasks responsibly. Autonomous agents are systems or
            entities like drones, robots, vehicles etc. which can perform tasks
            and operate independently without any human intervention.

            ‘Tamil Thai Vaazhthu’ rendition caught in controversy yet again
          </h2>
          <p id="p1">
            It was because of a technical fault; the mic did not function
            properly, says Deputy Chief Minister Udhayanidhi Stalin
          </p>
          <p>
            The incident triggered sharp reactions from political leaders,
            including Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin, who took to social
            media to express his displeasure. In a strongly worded message
            posted on X (formerly Twitter), Stalin said, “Governor or Aryan?
            Chanting the Tamil Thai Vaalthu after omitting the word ‘Dravidam’
            is tantamount to violating the law of Tamil Nadu. A person who does
            not act in accordance with the law and acts according to his whims
            and fancies does not deserve to hold the office.” The Chief Minister
            further criticized Governor R N Ravi, accusing him of deliberately
            insulting Tamil Nadu and its people by fostering an “allergy towards
            Dravidam”.
